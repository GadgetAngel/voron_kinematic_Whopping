## Voron V2 Kinematic Bed Brush Riser

![Completed Install](https://github.com/catid/voron/raw/master/kinematic_bed_brush_riser/completed_install2.jpg "Completed Install")

Designed to be used with the Whoppingpochard kinematic bed mod:
https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/kinematic_bed

This may be useful for other extra-tall beds.

## Prints:

One of either of these based on your height preference:

+ `BrushRiser16mmBolts.stl` : For 2 m3x16 mm bolts.
+ `BrushRiser20mmBolts.stl` : For 2 m3x20 mm bolts.

## Assembly:

Just install it under the Purge Bucket Brush.

I had to cut off the left Purge Bucket to fit on my printer, but the right one still works fine.
