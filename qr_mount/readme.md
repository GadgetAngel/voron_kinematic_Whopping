![Completed Install](https://github.com/catid/voron/raw/master/qr_mount/completed_install3.jpg "Completed Install")

## Materials:

Electronics:

+ Bondtech QR Extruder

Fasteners:

+ 2x m3 T-nuts
+ 2x m3x8 bolts
+ 2x m5x20 bolts
+ 2x m5 nuts

## Prints:

One of each of the STLs included:

+ `QRMountSpacer.stl` : Offsets the QRMountBody from the frame by the width of the back panel (3mm).
+ `QRMountBody.stl` : Carries the extruder.  Has nut traps underneath.  Should be held away from the back panel using a piece of filament to avoid vibration.
+ `QRMountTop.stl` : Locks in the extruder.

Designed to be used with this mod:

## Assembly:

Install the Bondtech QR Extruder into the QRMountBody using the QRMountTop.  Install nuts in the nut traps and screw the two m5 bolts into place.

Using the QRMountSpacer, bolt the QRMount assembly to the frame with T-nuts so that it is a short distance from the `exhaust_housing_side_entry` entry port.
The Bowden tube should line up precisely with the entry port on the other mod, so that the tube length is as short as possible.

To keep the extruder from vibrating against the back, place a bit of filament about mid-way up the mount along the back panel.
